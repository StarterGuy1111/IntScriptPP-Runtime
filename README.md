# IntScript++ Runtime

Intscript++ runtime is a special program, designed to run executables, with a file format, .IX.

## What is a .IX?

IX is a IntScript++ Executable, with goal to be a Lightwight and non-bloated alternative of EXE.

If you compared a simple Hello, World! print executable, u would see a giant change

IX: 20 bytes
EXE: 4KB

Also, when i create a compiler - you would stop using a hex editor to make a IX and code with the compiler.

## Running

To run a .IX, you would need those required files:

Runtime Build(build 1-0-2+, 1-0-1 and 1-0-2 cannot be used)
IntScript executable(file ending with .ix, has to be compatitble with build)

Now, you need a command prompt to run.
When you are in the cmd, you want to type this

## (your build) (your executable)

You need to change (your build) with your build executable, and (your executable) with the ix you got.


# Changes

build-1-0-0: Stil in early development, no file support, only hard-coded IX 

build-1-0-1: Added some stuff, beta file dev(broken)

build-1-0-2: Fixed file dev, but some things were broken while fixing it

build-1-0-3: Fully working build, with working file dev

build-1-0-4: Magic bytes.
